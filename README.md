# Sample Hardhat Project

The digestHash contract is used to calculate digestHash with user'd didUrl, VC's ctype, expirationDate and roothash.

* You can use `registerDigestHash` to register a digestHash on-chain. 


* You can use `calcDigestHash` to simpliy check the digestHash (not upload on chain)


* You can use `checkEthereumOwner` to check the digest belongs to which ethereumAddress


* You can use `checkDidOwner` to check the didAddress belongs to which ethereumAddress
